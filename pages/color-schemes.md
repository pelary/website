- [Batman](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#batman) - Low color, just grayscale and some pretty hidehous green/yellow shades. Pretty low contrast for the default white color. But overall looks great. Maybe just need a different base color for the accents.

- [FishTank](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#fishtank)

- [Grape](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#grape)

- [Hardcore](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#hardcore)

- [Harper](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#harper) - Low color

- [IC Orange PPL](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#ic-orange-ppl) - Very little contrast between the colors, looks mononchromatic.

- [IR Black](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#ir-black)

- [MonaLisa](https://github.com/dexpota/kitty-themes#monalisa) - Low contrast between the foreground colors.
